        For the social scientists, creating social networks from your mailbox data and among other things:
        * Discover subgroups within your organization (whether the different task forces established were as cohesive as it seems on the outside)  
        * Study social actors (most emails from Marketing involve Peter and Andy) and their relative influence  
        * Identify the key social groups (Sales team hangs out a lot, but the IT / product division less so)
        * Key account managers of the company (Despite being with the company only recently, Margaretha is connected to more key clients than her peers)
        
        
        If you're a graph theorist and looking for something more statistical:
        * Support directed and undirected graphs (**implemented in version 0.0.2**, see below)
        * Also output statistical measurements such as centrality distribution (**planned for version 0.0.3**)
        * Betweenness, closeness, hubness, distance histograms plotting (**planned for version 0.0.3**) 
        * Exports to `.graphml` format for use in other graphing software (**implemented in version 0.0.2**)
        
        ## Dependencies
        * Python 3.7+
        * Only dependencies are NetworkX and Matplotlib
        
        ## Example Usage
        To install `emailnetwork`:
        ```
        pip install emailnetwork
        ```
        
        A sample `.mbox` file is provided to you, but you can obtain export your own mailbox from your email service provider. If you use Google (Gmail), you can [use the Google Takeout service](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) to export your mail data.
        
        
        ```python
        from emailnetwork.extract import MBoxReader
        reader = MBoxReader('path-to-mbox.mbox')
        print(f'{len(reader)} emails in the sample mbox.')
        
        # extract a specific email
        email = reader.mbox[5]
        emailmsg = extract_meta(email)
        
        # filter emails by certain date
        thisyearmails = reader.filter_by_date('>=', '2021-01-05')
        
        # print email domains of recipients
        print(emailmsg.recipients)
        print(emailmsg.recipients[0].domain)
        
        # extract all emails
        emails = reader.extract()
        ```
        
        For graph visualization:
        ```py
        from emailnetwork.extract import MBoxReader
        # Read from .mbox
        MBOX_PATH = f'{os.path.dirname(__file__)}/tests/test.mbox'
        reader = MBoxReader(MBOX_PATH)
        
        # Try the following: 
        # plot a single directed graph the email at index 3
        plot_single_directed(reader,3)
        
        # plot a single undirected graph the email at index 3, show title in plot
        plot_single_undirected(reader, 1, showtitle=True)
        
        # plot a directed graph, optionally specifying a layout style
        plot_directed(reader)
        plot_directed(reader, 'shell')
        # optionally export a .graphml to your working directory for use
        # in other network / graphing software
        plot_undirected(reader, 'spring', graphml=True)
        ```
        
        #### Email Header Analysis 
        <img align="left" width="40%" src="https://github.com/onlyphantom/emailnetwork/raw/main/assets/histo.png?raw=true" style="margin-right:10%">
        To obtain a histogram:
        
        ```py
        from emailnetwork.extract import MBoxReader
        reader = MBoxReader('path-to-mbox')
        headers = HeaderCounter(reader)
        headers.histogram()
        # to show only top 10 header, set an optional n parameter
        # headers.histogram(n=10)
        ```
        Because `HeaderCounter` is a subclass of Python's `Counter`, you can also perform operations such as `headers.most_common(8)` to get the 8 most-common headers from the `mbox` file.
        
        If you want to find all email headers with the word "spam" in it (e.g spam score, other antispam mechanism), you can use Python's `filter()` function:
        ```python
        reader = MBoxReader('path-to-mbox')
        headers = HeaderCounter(reader)
        spamheaders = list(filter(lambda v: "spam" in v.lower(), headers.keys()))
        # return:
        # ['X-Spam-Checked-In-Group', 'X-Microsoft-Antispam-PRVS', 'X-Microsoft-Antispam-Untrusted', 'X-Microsoft-Antispam-Message-Info-Original', 'X-Forefront-Antispam-Report-Untrusted', 'x-ms-exchange-antispam-messagedata', 'X-Microsoft-Antispam', 'X-Microsoft-Antispam-Message-Info', 'X-Forefront-Antispam-Report', 'X-Mimecast-Spam-Score', 'x-microsoft-antispam-prvs', 'x-microsoft-antispam', 'x-microsoft-antispam-message-info', 'x-forefront-antispam-report']
        ```
        
        #### Mailbox Summary
        
        To get a simple barchart on the distribution of email domains in your `.mbox`, you can create a `DomainSummary` object and call the `.plot()` function:
        
        <img align="left" width="50%" src="https://github.com/onlyphantom/emailnetwork/raw/main/assets/summaryplot.png" />
        
        ```python
        from emailnetwork.summary import DomainSummary
        summary = DomainSummary(reader)
        summary.plot()
        ```
        
        You can also return a `Counter()` (a subclass of `dict`) instead of a plot:
        
        ```python
        summary.summary
        # return:
        # Counter({'supertype.ai': 203, 'hubspot.com': 115, 'gmail.com': 75, 'google.com': 53, 'adcolony.com': 38, 'fbworkmail.com': 35, 'elementor.com': 29, 'payoneer.com': 15, 'gogame.net': 14, 'zoomd.com': 13, 'am.atlassian.com': 10, 'theafternaut.com': 6, 'alegrium.com': 5, 'accounts.google.com': 4, 'e.atlassian.com': 4, 'tnbaura.com': 4, 'support.lazada.sg': 4, '3kraters.com': 3, 'go.facebookmail.com': 2, 'docs.google.com': 2, 'mail.hellosign.com': 2, 'algorit.ma': 2, 'supertype.atlassian.net': 2, 'ucdconnect.ie': 2, 'mc.facebookmail.com': 1, 'inplacesoftware.com': 1, 'aura.co': 1, 'atlassian.com': 1, 'greenhouse.io': 1})
        ```
        ##### Why Python 3.7+?
        Python 3.7+ is required because the package is written to take advantage of many features of Python 3.7 and above. 
        
        Examples of features that were used extensively in the creation of this package:
        * [Dataclasses, new in Python 3.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH_jLQvnpBo)
        * [Insertion-ordered Dictionaries, new in Python 3.7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-DBWPjpqWY)
        * [Typing (Type hints), new in Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
        * [Formatted string literal, new in Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)
        ## Testing
        Git clone, and run `nosetests`. You can also run nosetests with coverage:
        ```
        nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=emailnetwork
